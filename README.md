Project Name:  co-op

## The problem:
    Personal projects are one of the best ways to enhance your knowledge and to become a better professional at something, 
    but there is a lack of platforms that  help motivated people to connect, share each-others projects,  work and learn together. 

## Description of the idea:
	Platform where people can "co-work" or "co-learn" with each other. Share each other's projects and look for people who might be interested to spend their spare time working on some interesting ideas.
    
## Details
Domain details:
  There should be "news feed" like page where users will se projects depending on the categories that they have chosen. 
  At the moment idea is fully concentrated on Software Projects, Computer Science learning space, but can be enhanced.

Technical details:
  Frontend/Client: Javascript (framework: React)
  Backend/Service: Java (framework: Spring, Spring-boot)

  Backend <--- Client, happens using REST endpoints.
  
## Considerations
	- use reactive streams for back-end
	- use redux on front-end for state management
